\usage{
ExPanD(df, cs_id, ts_id, config_list = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data that containing the panel data that you want to explore}

\item{cs_id}{A character vector containing the names of the variables that
identify the cross-section in your data. The according variables should be factors.}
