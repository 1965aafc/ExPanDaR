## Overview

You are visiting the github repository of the ExPanDaR (Explore Panel Data with R) package. ExPanDaR provides the code base for the ExPanD web app. ExPanD is a shiny based app supporting interactive exploratory data analysis.

ExPanD has two purposes:

- Enable users to assess the robustness of empirical evidence without providing them with access to the underlying data.
- Provide a toolbox for researchers to explore panel data on the fly. 

While I hope that ExPanD will be particularly helpful in the academic review, publication and replication process I also think that it is convenient for typical exploratory data analysis workflows. In addition, it has already proven to be helpful in the classroom.

This is what ExPanD looks like:

```{r, out.width = "90%", fig.align="center", fig.border = "none", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("vignettes/figures/ExPanD_simple_03.jpg")
```

If you are interested to see what ExPanD has to offer without diving into R, click [here](https://jgassen.shinyapps.io/expand_wb/) to explore an instance of ExPanD that hosts World Bank data or click
[here](https://jgassen.shinyapps.io/expand_r3/) for a financial accounting and stock returns dataset of U.S. firms.

If you want to analyze your own panel data instead, you can also access a variant of ExPanD app [here](https://jgassen.shinyapps.io/expand/) that allows user-side data uploads. No worries: Your data won't be stored on the server and will get erased from memory as soon as you close the web connection. 


## Installation

If you are in for the full treat and want to test ExPanD from within R, run the following 
in your R session to install the ExPanDaR package from CRAN.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Include the following to add Bioconductor to your repositories
# when you have problems installing the package 'CodeDepends'
# that depends on 'graph' which is only available in the 
# Bioconductor repository
setRepositories(ind=1:2)

# Include the following if you want to use the data file upload 
# dialog in ExPanD()
install.packages("rio")

install.packages("ExPanDaR")
library(ExPanDaR)
````

Or, if you want to install the current development version from Github:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("joachim-gassen/ExPanDaR")
library(ExPanDaR)
````


## Basic Usage

You can either start ExPanD without arguments so that it starts with a file upload dialog...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ExPanD()
````

...or start with one of the two example datasets that come with the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ExPanD(df = worldbank,  
       df_def = worldbank_data_def, 
       var_def = worldbank_var_def,
       df_name = "World Bank Data",
       config_list = ExPanD_config_worldbank)

ExPanD(df = russell_3000,  
       df_def = russell_3000_data_def, 
       df_name = "Russell 3000",
       config_list = ExPanD_config_russell_3000)
````


## Further Information

For further information, please refer to the articles and function call references of the package documentation, available [here](https://joachim-gassen.github.io/ExPanDaR) for the CRAN version and 
[here](https://joachim-gassen.github.io/ExPanDaR/dev) for the current development version.

Enjoy!
