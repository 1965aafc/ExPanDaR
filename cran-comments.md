## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reduced the amount of data and the quality of the jpegs in the vignettes 
  so that the total size of the source tar ball is below 5 MB

* Rewritten the DESCRIPTION file to avoid redundancies

* Put all references to software in the DESCRIPTION file in single quotes

* I did not add any paper references to the Description field as the package 
  uses standard EDA methodology.
