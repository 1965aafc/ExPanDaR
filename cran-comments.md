## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Reduced the amount of data and the quality of the jpgs in the vognettes 
  so that the total size of the source tar ball is below 5 MB

* Rewritten the DESCRIPTION file to avoid redundancies

* Put all references to software in the DESCRIPTION file in single quotes
