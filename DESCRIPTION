Title: Explore Panel Data with R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joachim Gassen
Maintainer: Joachim Gassen <gassen@wiwi.hu-berlin.de>
Description: This package provides a set of functions for exploring panel data. 
    It uses a shiny-based frontend (the "ExPanD" app) to showcase its exploration tools 
    and standardized datastructure interfaces which make it easy to use the front-end for various datasets.
    It allows the use of multiple data alternative sources for constructing the exploration sample. 
    A data exploration is stored as a a list of choices. Using the ExPanDaR app, users can store 
    this list locally. If the function are called directly from within R code the list 
    (and its permutations) can be used to systematically assess the robustness of certain 
    research designs and findings.
