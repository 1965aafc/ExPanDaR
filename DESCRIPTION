Title: Explore Panel Data with R
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joachim Gassen
Maintainer: Joachim Gassen <gassen@wiwi.hu-berlin.de>
Description: This package provides a set of functions for exploratory data analysis 
    of panel data. It uses a shiny-based frontend (the "ExPanD" app) to showcase its 
    exploration tools and standardized data structure interfaces that make it easy 
    to use ExPanD on various datasets.
    It allows the use of multiple samples to construct exploration and hold-out 
    samples. In addition, it can separate base data from the analysis sample, 
    thereby also allowing users of the ExPanD app to generate additional variables
    interactively. A data exploration can be stored as a a list of choices using 
    the ExPanD app.
    The functions of this package can also be used directly in R code to support 
    your exploratory data analysis workflow.
