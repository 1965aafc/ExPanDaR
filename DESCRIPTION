Description: The ExPanDaR (Explore Panel Data with R) package 
    provides a shiny-based frontend (the "ExPanD" app) and
    a set of functions for exploratory panel data analysis. 
    The shiny-based ExPanD app enables users to assess the robustness of empirical 
    evidence without providing them with access to the underlying data.
    The functions of the ExPanDaR package can also be used directly in R code to support 
    your exploratory data analysis workflow. 
    Refer to the vignettes of the package for more information on how to use ExPanD
    and/or the functions of this package.
